# Wozmon fork
This is a fork of Wozmon for testing my 6502 emulation.

This requires CA65/LD65, which is part of the CC65 compiler toolchain. To compile automatically, I've written a Makefile.

The Wozmon source code is grabbed from this file: https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/blob/master/asm/wozmon/wozmon.s
